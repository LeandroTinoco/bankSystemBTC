Welcome to the Simplified Banking System project! This is a practical project aimed at creating a basic banking system using Java. The main goal is to consolidate concepts such as encapsulation, class creation, constructors, methods, and object manipulation in a realistic and functional scenario.

## Project Description

This project is a practical exercise of a simplified banking system in Java. It provides an opportunity to reinforce essential programming concepts including:
- Encapsulation
- Creation of classes
- Use of constructors
- Methods
- Object manipulation

The chosen unit of measurement for the project is BTC (Bitcoin) due to personal interest.
